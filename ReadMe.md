The basics of HTML structure
    Learned about the power of "!" on VSCode.
    Learned the importance and structure, spacing inside an HTML code.
    Learned how to embed file folder structures, images, and proper link structuring inside an html code.

I have been tackling the odin project for 4-5 hours a day, and I must admit that I am a very slow learner, but the self pacing has been perfect for me and for me my progress has been great! I hope to learn more from this project to kickstart my career as a fresh graduate from Information Technology, majoring in Cyber Security.
